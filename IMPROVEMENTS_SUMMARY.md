- **helpers.mdx**: Complete documentation of litesvm-token helper functions
- **types.mdx**: Type definitions, error types, and error handling patterns

**Key improvements:**
- Documented ALL methods with clear parameters and return types
- Added critical warnings about common pitfalls
- Included working code examples for every method
- Explained error types and how to handle them

### 2. **Troubleshooting Guide** âœ…
Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide addressing all major issues from the feedback:
- Privilege escalation errors (with exact solutions)
- Invalid owner errors (mint initialization requirements)
- Program deployment failures (ID mismatch issues)
- Account not found errors
- Account closing issues
- Custom program error handling
- Quick reference table of common fixes

**Real solutions for real problems** - Every issue documented is from actual test failures with tested solutions.

### 3. **Enhanced Program Deployment Documentation** âœ…
Completely rewrote the deployment documentation to address critical issues:
- **CRITICAL WARNING**: Program ID must match keypair (most common failure)
- Complete working examples with verification
- Helper functions for safe deployment
- Debugging deployment failures
- CPI dependency deployment

### 4. **Best Practices Guide** âœ…
Created comprehensive best practices covering:
- The Golden Rules (4 critical rules to always follow)
- Account meta configuration rules (with clear examples)
- Program deployment patterns
- Token testing patterns
- Transaction building best practices
- Error handling patterns
- Test organization strategies
- Performance optimization
- Debugging tips

### 5. **Debugging Guide** âœ…
Created advanced debugging guide with:
- Transaction failure analysis
- Log analysis techniques
- State inspection tools
- Binary search debugging
- PDA debugging
- CPI debugging
- Time-based debugging
- Performance debugging
- Common debug scenarios with solutions

### 6. **Updated Navigation Structure** âœ…
Reorganized documentation for better discoverability:
- Added API Reference to main navigation
- Added Troubleshooting after examples
- Added Debugging guide
- Added Best Practices section
- Logical flow from basics to advanced topics

## ðŸ“Š Issues Addressed from Feedback

### Critical Issues Fixed:
1. âœ… **Missing API documentation** - Complete API reference created
2. âœ… **Account writability rules** - Documented with clear examples
3. âœ… **Program ID must match keypair** - Added critical warnings and examples
4. âœ… **All mints must be initialized** - Documented prominently in multiple places
5. âœ… **Privilege escalation causes** - Complete troubleshooting section
6. âœ… **Account closing behavior** - Explained LiteSVM differences
7. âœ… **CPI and PDA issues** - Debugging patterns and solutions
8. âœ… **Token operation failures** - Helper documentation and patterns

### Documentation Gaps Filled:
- âœ… Complete method signatures and return types
- âœ… Error handling patterns
- âœ… Debugging transaction failures
- âœ… Account meta configuration rules
- âœ… Token decimal handling
- âœ… Batch operation patterns
- âœ… Test organization patterns

## ðŸ“ˆ Impact

These improvements address **100% of the critical issues** raised in the feedback:

1. **Reduced debugging time**: Clear error messages and solutions
2. **Prevented common failures**: Golden rules and best practices
3. **Better API understanding**: Complete reference documentation
4. **Faster problem resolution**: Troubleshooting guide with real solutions
5. **Improved test quality**: Best practices and patterns

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Future Improvements)

While the critical documentation is now complete, potential future enhancements could include:

1. **Complete Working Examples**:
   - Full escrow program test
   - Token swap implementation
   - NFT testing patterns

2. **Migration Guide**:
   - From solana-test-validator to LiteSVM
   - Performance comparisons
   - Feature differences

3. **Video Tutorials**:
   - Getting started walkthrough
   - Common testing patterns
   - Debugging techniques

## Summary

The LiteSVM documentation has been transformed from having significant gaps to being comprehensive and practical. Every issue that caused test failures in the feedback has been addressed with clear documentation and working examples. Developers now have:

- Complete API reference
- Real solutions to real problems
- Clear best practices
- Advanced debugging tools
- Proper navigation and organization

The documentation now prevents the issues that previously caused "4+ hours of debugging" and provides the guidance needed for successful Solana program testing with LiteSVM.
